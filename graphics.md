Fundamentals of Graphic Design
Graphic design is the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content. This pertains to drawing, painting, writing etc.

Types of Computer Graphics
Computer graphics can be separated into two different categories: Raster Graphics and Vector Graphics.

Questions to guide you on raster and vector images:
What is a raster image?

What is a vector image?

How are raster and vector images different?

When should you use raster or vector?

Raster Vs Vector Images
Raster images, also known as bitmaps, are comprised of individual pixels of color. Each color pixel contributes to overall image. Raster images might be compared to pointillist paintings, which are composed with a series of individually-colored dots of paint. When viewed as an individual dot, it's just a color but when viewed as a whole, the colored dots make up a vivid and detailed painting.

Raster images cannot be scaled to larger sizes. When they are scaled, quality is lost, and they become blurry, as each pixel becomes larger or photo editing software attempts to compromise by adding colored pixels. There are different types of raster files: JPG, GIF, and PNG. Raster images are ideal for photo editing and creating digital paintings in programs such as Photoshop and GIMP.

Vector Graphics
Vector graphics are made up of paths, each with a mathematical formula (vector) that tells the path how it is shaped and what color it is bordered with or filled by. Vector images can be created and edited in programs such as Illustrator, CorelDraw and Inkscape.

Vectors can be indefinitely scaled without loss of quality, hence they are excellent for logos, illustrations, engravings, etc.

Vector File Types:
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) - .svg

Encapsulated PostScript File (EPS) - .eps

Adobe Illustrator File - .ai

Collaborative Design Activity - .dae

PostScript - .ps

Enhanced MetaFile (EMF) - .emf

Skills Needed to be A Graphic Designer
Technical Skills - Typography Skills:
As a graphic designer, you must be able to arrange words and letters in a visually appealing way. Typography is the style or appearance of text. Most brands choose two or three fonts - often inspired by the logo - for basic, everyday use. Note: Graphic design is all about communicating ideas with images.

Soft Skills:
As a graphic designer, you should have the following soft skills:

Collaboration skills

Emotional intelligence

Communication Skills

Time management

Creativity

Storytelling

Strategy

Problem solving

Elements of Design
Color: helps establish a mood for your composition.

Line: refers to the way that two points in space are connected. Whether they're horizontal lines, diagonal lines, or vertical lines, lines can help direct the eye toward a certain point in your composition.

Value: refers to the lightness or darkness of a color.

Shape: is a two-dimensional area that is surrounded by an outline. Graphic artists can use other elements including line, color, value, and shadow to give a shape the appearance of a three-dimensional shape.

Form: pertains to the way that a shape or physical configuration occupies space.

Texture: is one of the elements of design that is used to represent how an object appears or feels. Tactile texture is a physical sense of touch, whether it's rough, smooth, or ribbed. Visual texture, on the other hand, refers to the imagined feel of the illustrated texture, which can create more visual interest and a heightened sensory experience.

Design Theory - Color Theory
90% of consumers evaluate a brand or design based on color alone and according to studies. Brightness and low saturation create a soft feeling as shown in the example below. Also weaker contrast and weaker saturation conveys calmness whereas a stronger contrast and stronger saturation conveys activeness.

Many brands and many designs use red or similar colors to grab attention and to create hard solid memories to the audience. Think of brands like CNN or Target as examples. Where as dimness and high saturation creates a hard or strong feeling.

Age and gender. Studies have shown that women tend to prefer softer more pastel colors, whereas men prefer bolder colors. It's important to note that this is just an average and won't apply to everyone in our group. But when making designs and decisions on those designs, we aim to kind of appeal to the majority of a target audience and not just the minority.

Color theory: Different hues and the feelings they often elicit:
Red: excitement, danger, energy, courage, strength, anger.

Orange: creativity, enthusiasm, health, happiness, encouragement, balance, energy.

Yellow: sunshine, hope, optimism, light, positivity, freshness.

Green: health, nature, renewal, generosity, freshness, environment.

Blue: freedom, trust, expansiveness, dependability, faith, inspiration.

Purple: royalty, luxury, power, pride, creativity, mystery.

Design Theory - Gestalt Theory
Gestalt Theory suggests that the brain does all kinds of weird and wonderful things when presented with a complex group of images or assets. Principles of Gestalt theory do form themselves around a single base theory that the human brain subconsciously functions in a very specific way. Basically, how our brain interacts with the outside world.

Continuation:
Take a look at this picture. What is the first thing you notice? Notice how the basketball frame arches over to the player itself, the eye naturally follows this path.

Figure and Ground:
Essentially, this is the way your brain subconsciously processes negative space. It's why when you see the NBC logo, you see the body of a peacock, and not just some random white space, or how people can notice an arrow in the FedEx logo. This is the brain and making sense of a collection of design elements. And a clever designer can hack the brain from the viewpoint of figure and ground. That is if they want to communicate something on their design that uses negative space, it's a great way to add in kind of secret messages or hidden meanings into your designs.

It also can be seen in logo design, an example in Amazon that leads your eye from A to Zed.

PROMPT ENGINEERING
What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering involves crafting specific prompts or instructions to guide AI models in generating desired responses. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that language models produce creative and accurate outputs, by providing clear and targeted instructions.

Principles of Prompt Engineering
Clarity: Prompts should be clear and easy to understand. Avoid jargon and technical terms that may confuse the user.

Specificity: Prompts should be specific and provide clear instructions. Avoid vague or ambiguous language that may lead to incorrect or incomplete responses.

Relevance: Prompts should be relevant to the task or goal at hand. Avoid including unnecessary information or distractions that may confuse or mislead the Intelligent Model.

Prompt Engineering Approaches
Zero-shot Prompting:
In zero-shot prompting, we provide the LLM a prompt that describes the task, but the prompt does not provide any examples for the task. The LLM is then asked to generate a response to the prompt.

Few-shot Prompting:
Few-shot prompting can provide demonstrations to steer the model to better performance. It is a technique for providing LLMs with a few examples of the desired output, in addition to the prompt. The examples help the model to better understand the task and to generate more accurate and informative responses.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting:
This is a method that encourages LLMs to explain their reasoning process. This is achieved by providing the model with a few-shot exemplars where the reasoning process is explicitly outlined. The LLM is then expected to follow a similar reasoning process when answering the prompt. This technique has been found to significantly improve the model's performance on tasks that require complex reasoning.

Example:
Q: Joe has 20 eggs. He buys 2 more cartons of eggs. Each carton contains 12 eggs. How many eggs does Joe have now?
A: Joe started with 20 eggs. 2 cartons of 12 eggs is 24 eggs. 20 + 24 = 44. Therefore, Joe has 44 eggs, and the answer is 44.

Q: Farmer John had 93 chickens. If he sold 20 to Farmer Bill and bought twice that number more, how many chickens does Farmer John have now?

Best Practices in Prompt Engineering
Understand the desired outcome: Successful prompt engineering is largely a matter of knowing what questions to ask and how to ask them effectively. But this means nothing if the user doesn't know what they want in the first place.

Make clear, specific requests: AI is neither psychic nor telepathic. It's not your best buddy and it has not known you since primary school; the system can only act based on what it can interpret from a given prompt. Form clear, explicit and actionable requests. Understand the desired outcome, then work to describe the task that needs to be performed or articulate the question that needs to be answered.

Importance of Prompt Engineering in Guiding Language Models
Accurate Responses: Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in guiding language models to generate accurate responses. By carefully crafting the prompt, we can provide the model with the necessary context and information to generate precise and correct answers.

Contextually Appropriate Responses: In addition to accuracy, prompt engineering helps language models generate contextually appropriate responses. By framing the prompt in a way that aligns with the desired tone, style, or context, we can ensure that the model's output is relevant and suitable for the given situation.

Guided Responses: Prompt engineering allows us to guide the model's responses by providing relevant context and constraints. By shaping the prompts, we can influence the output and steer the model towards desired outcomes.

Clear Instructions: By carefully crafting prompts, we can provide specific and unambiguous instructions to the model. Clear instructions help the model understand the desired output and generate more accurate responses.

Comprehensive Overview of Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) models. It involves designing and refining prompts to achieve desired outputs and improve model performance. This section provides a comprehensive overview of prompt engineering, covering all key aspects discussed in the presentation.

Prompt Design: Designing effective prompts that elicit the desired information or response from the model. This involves considering the target task, dataset, and model architecture.

Prompt Tuning: Iteratively refining and optimizing prompts to improve model performance. This may involve adjusting the wording, structure, or format of the prompt.

Prompt Variations: Creating variations of prompts to enhance model robustness and generalization. This can involve using synonyms, paraphrases, or different sentence structures.

Prompt Context: Providing relevant context or background information in prompts to guide the model's understanding and generate more accurate responses.

Prompt Language: Choosing appropriate language and tone in prompts to ensure clarity and avoid bias. This includes considering the target audience and cultural nuances.

Prompt Evaluation: Evaluating the effectiveness of prompts through metrics and user feedback. This helps identify areas for improvement and refine prompt engineering strategies.

Prompt Maintenance: Continuously monitoring and updating prompts to adapt to changing data, user needs, and model performance. This ensures long-term effectiveness and relevance.
